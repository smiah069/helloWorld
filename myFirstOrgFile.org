** Export to md  
   The default /org-mode/ does not have the option to export .org file to /markdown/ (.md file).   For that you will need to replace the *org* layer in /dotspacemacs/ file   with the   following 


   \begin{verbatim}
        (org :variables
             org-enable-github-support t)
   \end{verbatim} 


   Latex Equation can be exported to /markdown/


   \begin{equation}
    x = \sqrt{b}
   \end{equation}


   *Note: In case C-c C-e command doesn't show the export option for m (markdown), then simply open dotspacemacs file and complile it with M-SPC f e R.* After that, you should see the option to export to markdown!
