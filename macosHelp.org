*How to point matlab to a license server in MACOS:*

1. Open a new text editor and create a "network.lic" file

2. Write the following lines in the "network.lic" and save

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  # LicenseNo: Unknown

  # You must fill in the server_name, hostid, and port_number

  # fields below using the values from the license server.

  SERVER server_name hostid port_number

  USE_SERVER

  Note:
#+END_QUOTE

1. You need to replace server_name with your license server name (for >
   example: ece2.bradley.edu)

2. Your license administrator should give you a license file (for >
   example: 2017alicense.lic), open this file using a text editor and >
   and look for HostID (which is the mac address) in the second line

3. Replace "hostid" in the "network.lic" with the 12 digit HostID (for >
   example: 001A708F8AEB) that you just copied

4. Replace the "port_number" in the network.lic file with the port >
   number (for example: 2200) given by your license administrator

3. Finally save your network.lic file that should like like:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  # LicenseNo: Unknown

  # You must fill in the server_name, hostid, and port_number

  # fields below using the values from the license server.

  SERVER ece2.bradley.edu 001A708F8AEB 2200

  USE_SERVER
#+END_QUOTE

4. Right click on the matlap app (MATLAB_R2017a.app) -> Show package
   contents

5. In the "licenses" folder, replace the network.lic file with the one
   that you just created.
